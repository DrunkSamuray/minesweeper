# Minesweeper Game

## Purposes
This repository is my first experience with GitHub. Minesweeper is very funny and famous game, and I am so excited I can do it myself.

## Game Look

## Known issues
The provided exe does not run on Windows 10 LTSC. It reports an error instead, "libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll not found".

## TODO
  * Solve the issues
  * Rewrite the project in C + SDL
  * Make the repository more structured
  
## Notes
This is very old version of Minesweeper that was worked, but not tested on a Windows 10 and higher. It was made via C++ and SFML. Now I have a working prototype of it in C and SDL, but have no time to do it right and push it into repository properly.
